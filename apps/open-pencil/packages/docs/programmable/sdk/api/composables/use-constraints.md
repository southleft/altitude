# useConstraints

`useConstraints()` provides selection-derived horizontal and vertical constraint state plus
undo-aware actions.

```ts
import { useConstraints } from '@open-pencil/vue'

const constraints = useConstraints()
constraints.setAxis('horizontal', 'STRETCH')
constraints.togglePin('vertical', 'trailing', false)
```

- `active` requires every selected node to be an eligible child of a frame-like container.
- `horizontal` and `vertical` return `MIN`, `CENTER`, `MAX`, `STRETCH`, `SCALE`, or `MIXED`.
- Multi-selection updates are grouped into one undo entry.
- Normal auto-layout children are excluded; absolutely positioned children remain eligible.

Use `constraintPins()` and `toggleConstraintPin()` to build a custom accessible pin diagram without
duplicating mode mapping.
