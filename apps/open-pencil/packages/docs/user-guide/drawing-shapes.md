# Drawing Shapes

The bottom toolbar provides tools for creating shapes, frames, and sections. Select a tool, then click and drag on the canvas to draw.
## Toolbar Tools

| Tool | Shortcut | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Rectangle | <kbd>R</kbd> | Draws a rectangle |
| Ellipse | <kbd>O</kbd> | Draws an ellipse |
| Line | <kbd>L</kbd> | Draws a line |
| Frame | <kbd>F</kbd> | Draws a frame (container for other nodes) |
| Section | <kbd>S</kbd> | Draws a section (auto-adopts overlapping siblings) |

## Shapes Flyout

The shapes flyout (accessible from the toolbar) includes additional shapes:

- **Polygon** — creates a polygon with 3 sides by default (triangle)
- **Star** — creates a 5-pointed star with 0.38 inner radius

Polygon and Star have no keyboard shortcut — access them from the shapes flyout in the toolbar.

## Constrained Drawing

Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging to constrain the shape:

- Rectangle → square (equal width and height)
- Ellipse → circle
- Line → snaps to 0°/45°/90° angles

## Shape Properties

After drawing a shape, select it to edit its properties in the Design tab of the properties panel.

### Fill

Every shape can have a fill. The fill section supports:

- **Solid color** — pick via the HSV color picker or type a hex value
- **Gradient** — Linear, Radial, Angular, or Diamond with editable gradient stops
- **Image** — select an image file as the fill

### Stroke

Add an outline to any shape. Stroke properties include:

- **Width** — uniform or per-side (Top/Right/Bottom/Left) via the side selector dropdown
- **Color** — solid color with opacity
- **Alignment** — Inside, Center, or Outside the shape boundary (clip-based rendering matches Figma behavior)
- **Cap style** — None, Round, Square, Arrow Lines, Arrow Equilateral (for open paths)
- **Join style** — Miter, Bevel, Round
- **Dash pattern** — dash-on/dash-off

### Corner Radius

Available for rectangles, frames, components, and instances. Click the independent corners toggle to set each corner (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) separately.

### Effects

Add visual effects from the Effects section:

- **Drop Shadow** — offset, blur radius, spread, color
- **Inner Shadow** — same controls, rendered inside the shape
- **Layer Blur** — blurs the entire node
- **Background Blur** — blurs content behind the node
- **Foreground Blur** — blurs content in front

Click **+** to add an effect. Each effect row is collapsible with inline controls. Toggle the eye icon to enable/disable an effect.

## Frames and Sections

**Frames** are containers. Drag shapes into a frame to make them children. Frames can clip their content (off by default) and support [auto layout](./auto-layout).

Select the Frame tool to browse collapsible presets for phones, tablets, desktops, presentations, watches, paper, social media, Figma Community assets, and archived devices in the Design panel. Choosing a preset creates a named frame centered in the viewport and returns to the Select tool. With an existing frame selected, use its Frame preset dropdown to resize it without changing its name.

**Sections** are top-level containers that automatically adopt overlapping sibling nodes when drawn. They're useful for organizing large canvases into logical areas. Sections display a title pill that you can drag.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Mac | Windows / Linux |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Rectangle tool | <kbd>R</kbd> | <kbd>R</kbd> |
| Ellipse tool | <kbd>O</kbd> | <kbd>O</kbd> |
| Line tool | <kbd>L</kbd> | <kbd>L</kbd> |
| Frame tool | <kbd>F</kbd> | <kbd>F</kbd> |
| Section tool | <kbd>S</kbd> | <kbd>S</kbd> |
| Constrain to square/circle | <kbd>Shift</kbd> + drag | <kbd>Shift</kbd> + drag |

## Tips

- Sections can only exist at the top level — they can't be nested inside frames.
- Use frames with [auto layout](./auto-layout) to build responsive layouts.
- [Export](./exporting) individual shapes or groups as images via the properties panel or context menu.
