# Pen Tool

The pen tool creates vector paths using a vector network data model, compatible with Figma's .fig format.
## Activating

Press <kbd>P</kbd> to activate the pen tool.

## Placing Points

- **Click** to place a corner point (straight-line segment)
- **Click + drag** to place a curve point with bezier tangent handles — the drag direction and length control the curve shape
  - **Hold <kbd>Space</kbd>** while dragging (without releasing the mouse button) to move the point itself

Click multiple points to build a path segment by segment. A preview line extends from the last placed point to your cursor as you move.

## Closing a Path

Click on the **first point** of the path to close it into a loop. Closed paths can be filled.

## Open Paths

Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to commit the current path as an open path. Open paths render as strokes only — they're not filled.

## Vector Networks

Paths in OpenPencil use vector networks — a more flexible model than simple point lists that supports branching paths and complex topology. This is the same model Figma uses, so paths round-trip perfectly in .fig files.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Mac | Windows / Linux |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Pen tool | <kbd>P</kbd> | <kbd>P</kbd> |
| Commit open path | <kbd>Escape</kbd> | Escape |

## Tips

- The preview line always starts from the last placed point — it won't jump to (0,0).
- Drag longer when placing a curve point to make the curve wider.
- After creating a path, use the properties panel to adjust its fill, stroke, and effects.
