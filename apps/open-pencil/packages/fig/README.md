# @open-pencil/fig

`.fig` file-format package for OpenPencil.

The package owns the outer `.fig` archive boundary and is the staged home for Figma-specific
SceneGraph conversion policy. Production SceneGraph read/write remains available through
`@open-pencil/core/io` while conversion modules move behind this package's public API.

Current ownership:

- Complete `.fig` archive parsing through `parseFigBuffer()`
- `.fig` archive assembly through `writeFigArchive()`
- Canvas payload and image resource handling
- `readFigContainer()` / `writeFigContainer()` helpers for raw `fig-kiwi` payloads
- `.fig` source and archive result types
- NodeChange-to-SceneGraph property conversion, including styles, plugin metadata, text, paint, vector, and font policy, through `@open-pencil/fig/node-change`
- Component-property, symbol-override, derived-symbol-data, and instance synchronization policy through `@open-pencil/fig/instance-overrides`
- Effective raw-metadata precedence and invalidation over SceneGraph's format-neutral edited-field tracking
- SceneGraph-to-`NodeChange` export conversion with an explicit glyph-outline runtime service
- Package-local archive, conversion, instance, export, and dist smoke tests

Planned ownership:

- Oracle-backed `.fig` fixtures

Non-goals:

- Generic Kiwi schema/runtime internals — use `@open-pencil/kiwi`
- Format-neutral IO registration, export targeting, CanvasKit thumbnails, or browser workers — use
  `@open-pencil/core/io`
- Editor actions, renderer behavior, Vue/app UI, CLI formatting, or MCP transport

This follows the existing `@open-pencil/pen` pattern: a format package owns its source model/parser
and SceneGraph policy, while core registers it in the shared IO system.
