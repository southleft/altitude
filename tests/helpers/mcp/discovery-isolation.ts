 * Test preload: isolate the MCP discovery file so `bun test` runs never
 * clobber the real `~/Library/Application Support/OpenPencil/mcp.json`.
 *
 * Deleting that file while the OpenPencil desktop app is running breaks every
 * MCP client: the discovery file is the only place the server's auth token is
 * published, so stdio bridges fall back to a null token and every /rpc call
 * returns 401 (surfacing as a spurious "auth issue"). The engine tests in
 * tests/engine/mcp/** call startServer()/handle.close() which writes and then
 * removes the discovery file — without isolation they did so at the real
 * platform path.
 *
 * Honored via OPENPENCIL_MCP_DISCOVERY_PATH in getDiscoveryPath()
 * (packages/mcp/src/transport/paths.ts). Per-process temp path so parallel
 * bun workers don't collide. A crypto.randomUUID() suffix guarantees that
 * PID reuse after a crash cannot reuse a stale discovery dir from a prior
 * process that happened to recycle the same PID. An operator-provided value
 * is respected.

 * user's live PID, e.g. on a shared, non-sticky temp directory.) Unknown
 * error shapes are also treated as "alive" — conservative: don't clean up
 * resources if we're not sure the process is dead. Only ESRCH (no such
