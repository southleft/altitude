# Contributing

Before contributing to this design system, please familiarize yourself with our [code guidelines](./CODE_GUIDELINES.mdx). If you have any questions, feature requests, or encounter bugs, feel free to contact the [Southleft team](https://southleft.com) for assistance.

## Workflow

### Git Flow

We utilize [Git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to manage our development workflow. Here's an overview:

- The `main` branch always reflects the latest production-ready version of the component library. Each commit to `main` signifies a new release.
- Development occurs on the `development` branch.
- `feature` branches are used for standalone or larger product features, following the naming convention `feature/[feature-name]`.
- `release` branches prepare for the next library release, where only bug fixes and metadata changes should occur.
- `hotfix` branches address critical fixes for production.

### Contribution workflow

To contribute to the design system, follow these steps:

1. Create a feature branch from `development` named `feature/[FEATURE NAME]`.
2. Implement the feature according to our [code guidelines](./CODE_GUIDELINES.mdx).
3. Update the CHANGELOG to document your changes.
4. Issue a pull request into the `development` branch, adhering to our merge request guidelines.
5. Our library owners and/or trusted contributors will review your work, providing feedback or approving the merge request.
6. Upon approval, your feature will be merged into `development` for inclusion in the next Web Components release.
