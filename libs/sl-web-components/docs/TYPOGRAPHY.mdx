# Typography

Typography in SL Web Components follows [the same structure as design tokens](./TOKENS.mdx), with the exception that typography operates as a _cluster_ of typography-specific style properties rather than a single style property.

## Tier 1: Typography values

Typography-specific design tokens are found in `tokens/tier-1/typography.json` and define these properties:

- `font-size`
- `font-family`
- `font-weight`
- `line-height`

These token values are _never to be used_ directly by components; these token values are assembled into typography presets.

## Tier 1: Typography presets

[Sass mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin) are used to cluster typography-specific tokens together into [typography presets](https://superfriendlydesign.systems/articles/typography-in-design-systems/). For example:

```scss
// typography-presets.scss
@mixin sl-typography-preset-12() {
  font-family: var(--sl-font-family-primary);
  font-weight: var(--sl-font-weight-regular);
  line-height: var(--sl-line-height-1);
  font-size: var(--sl-font-size-12);
  letter-spacing: var(--sl-letter-spacing-0);
  text-transform: none;
}
```

Just as with other Tier 1 tokens, typography presets shouldn't be used directly by components. Typography presets are mapped to specific semantic usage at the Tier 2 level.

## Tier 2: Typography usage

Tier 2 typography values take the typography presets defined at the Tier 2 level and map them to a semantic usage value like so:

```scss
// typography-usage.scss
@mixin sl-theme-typography-body-sm() {
  @include sl-typography-preset-14();
}
```

These semantic values are then included in each component's style file:

```scss
.sl-c-breadcrumbs {
  @include sl-theme-typography-body-sm();
}
```
