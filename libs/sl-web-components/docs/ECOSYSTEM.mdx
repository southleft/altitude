# Ecosystem

Welcome to our design system, designed to provide exceptional UI experiences for applications.

- **SL** represents our design language, consisting of design tokens defining styles for color, typography, shadows, borders, animations, layout, and other essential attributes.
- **SL Web Components** are native web components serving as the UI source of truth for markup, styles, and presentational JavaScript within Block.
- **SL Angular** is an Angular library that encapsulates SL Web Components, enabling their consumption within Angular-powered applications.
- **SL React** is a React library that encapsulates SL Web Components, facilitating their usage within React-powered applications.

The ecosystem collectively forms the UI layer of an application, depicted as follows:

```
SL + SL Web Components + (optional) SL Framework Wrapper = UI layer of application
```

For inquiries regarding the SL ecosystem, feel free to contact the [Southleft team](https://southleft.com) for assistance.
