# Icon Font

Icon fonts allow you to easily scale icons to any size without loss of quality, which can be beneficial for responsive web design where icons need to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

**IMPORTANT**: However, it's crucial to note that while icon fonts offer scalability, they should be deprioritized in usage. This is because they present accessibility challenges and may not scale optimally in all situations. Additionally, icon fonts may encounter compatibility issues with right-to-left (RTL) languages. Therefore, it's recommended to prioritize component icons that utilize SVGs for better accessibility, scalability, and language support.

## Usage Guidelines

Import the `iconfont.css` stylesheet into your component or document head.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="~sl-web-components/dist/fonts/iconfont.css" />
```

Then, you can use the <i></i> tag with the desired class name.

```html
<i class="icon icon-chevron-down"></i>
```

Alternatively, you can use a Unicode character with a font family of iconfont to render the icon (refer to iconfont.css for character reference).

```html
<style>
  .my-class {
    font-family: 'iconfont';
  }
</style>

<p class="my-class">\uf105</p>
```

## Adding Icons

1. Add the icon SVG file to `./libs/sl-web-components/icons/svgs`.  This location is the source of truth for all icons in the design system.
2. Run `yarn workspace sl-web-components build:icons` to generate all the icons files.

**IMPORTANT**: Never directly update any icon files outside of ./libs/sl-web-components/icons/svgs. Changes made here will be overwritten when the build:icons command is run.

### Formatting icons

Properly formatting icons is crucial to ensure they render correctly as icon fonts. Follow these steps in Adobe Illustrator:

  1. Run Pathfinder > Divide
  2. Apply a fill to the svg
  3. Delete the filled in areas
  4. Make the svg a Compound Path
  5. Export the svg

## Modifiying icons

To modify an existing icon, override the corresponding SVG icon file with the new icon. However, take care when releasing modified icons, as certain changes may constitute breaking changes to the library. Refer to the [releasing guidelines](./RELEASING.mdx) for guidance on rolling out icon updates.

## Removing icons

Removing icons must be done manually to prevent breaking changes. Follow these steps:

1. Delete the svg file from `./libs/sl-web-components/icons/svgs`
2. Delete all applicable icon files in the `sl-web-components` and `sl-react` directories

**Note:** After removing icons, check the following files modified by the generate icons pipeline:

```
sl-web-components/components/icon/fonts/*
sl-web-components/components/icon/icons/*
sl-web-components/components/icon/svgs/*
sl-web-components/.storybook/components/icon-svgs/icons.ts
sl-react/components/Icons/*
sl-react/src/index.ts
```
