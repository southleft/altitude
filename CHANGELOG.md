# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- The desktop app now requires macOS 13 or later; the web app supports Chrome 111, Edge 111, Firefox 128, and Safari 16.4 or later.

### Fixed

- Show what to update instead of a blank window when the browser or system WebView is too old, naming the detected macOS, Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, WebKitGTK, or WebView2 version and linking a prefilled bug report, and explain a failed start the same way (#744).
- Start on macOS 13 with WebKit older than Safari 17.4, which previously failed with `Promise.withResolvers is not a function` (#744).

## 0.15.1 — 2026-09-18

### Added

- Configure built-in AI and local MCP tool access independently on a Tool access page, including optional extended AI tools, searchable read-only and side-effect groups, and per-target defaults (#584).
- Set the built-in AI's maximum steps per message in Chat settings, including a custom number, with consistent stopping and remaining-step warnings (#573).
- Open documents and jump to a named layer from `openpencil://open?file=&node=` links, resolving the file against open tabs or a one-time file picker. Path segments match the way the filesystem does: case-insensitively on macOS and Windows, exactly on Linux.
- Open documents and jump to a named layer in the web app from `?file=&node=` links, fetching the file from an `https:` URL without credentials, ignoring the URL fragment, and refusing a document larger than 64 MiB — a ceiling the automation bridge's `openFile` now shares.

### Changed

- Create new documents with the sRGB colour profile, so Display P3 is reserved for documents that declare it.
- Export diagnostics from Settings only, with a retention count you choose. AI requests and tool activity now carry conversation and request identifiers, while chat no longer offers a separate diagnostic log or includes transcript content.
- Replace the demo's legacy reference page with a component library on the first page, including component sets, linked instances, component properties, and the variable collections, and show the standard canvas loading overlay and tab indicator while it is generated instead of an empty canvas.

### Fixed

- Store colours edited in the colour picker in the document's colour profile, and convert them on the way to the display, so a Display-P3 document no longer looks different on an sRGB display than on a wide-gamut one.
- Keep Display-P3 documents rendering correctly in wide gamut where the browser supports it and in sRGB elsewhere, fixing the black rectangles and incorrect blend colours, with a dismissible notice when wide gamut is unavailable.
- Classify MCP `open_file` and `close_file` operations as read-only hints, and close opened document tabs through the new `close_file` tool with the usual unsaved-change prompt.
- Let the desktop app use an MCP server you started yourself by allowing the app's own origin by default, instead of requiring `OPENPENCIL_MCP_CORS_ORIGIN`.
- Explain why the local MCP server did not start — a missing `@open-pencil/mcp` install, a denied command, an early exit, or an unreachable address — with translated guidance, and find a globally installed server when the desktop app is launched from the system shell.
- Animate the AI chat tool-call disclosure, which expanded and collapsed without motion because its animation classes were misspelled.
- Mark unsaved documents and ask whether to save before closing a tab, the desktop window, or the application, rather than relying on recovery alone.
- Defer AI provider connections and system credential reads until you send a message or use a connected feature, so opening documents and browsing chat history no longer trigger unexpected credential prompts.
- Save and recover documents whose text uses disabled numeric, fraction, or small-caps OpenType features, which previously failed to write a `.fig` file.
- Update instance text properties on the canvas while typing, with grouped undo for rapid edits.
- Point Homebrew installation instructions to the official `openpencil` cask and document separate CLI installation.
- Reach the custom model option in the model picker for providers with large model catalogs instead of requiring a search for it.

### Performance

- Reduce editor pauses while generating recovery snapshots and exporting text-heavy `.fig` documents.
- Recompute layout only for the pages an edit affects, instead of every page, when editing a component or its instances.

## 0.15.0 — 2026-09-16

### Breaking changes

- Use MCP SDK v2 server/client types for programmatic MCP integrations. Define custom tools with native Valibot `input` schemas and execution metadata instead of `params`, `ParamDef`, or `paramToZod()`.
- Replace Scene Graph `overrides` records with `instanceOverrides`, using separate `self` and `descendants` maps. Rename `figmaDerivedLayout`, `figmaDerivedTextGlyphs`, and `FigmaDerivedTextGlyph` to `derivedLayout`, `derivedTextGlyphs`, and `DerivedTextGlyph`.
- Update custom Vue SDK binding providers to implement `getBindingId()` and handle `unresolved`. Replace `setValue()` with `prepareEdit()`, returning a stable edit key, captured value, setter, and restoration callback.
- Replace Vue SDK `useDialogMessages()`, `dialogMessages`, and their catalog keys with the corresponding product-domain message composables and catalogs.
- Use Vue 3.5.41 or newer within Vue 3 for the Vue SDK, and CanvasKit 0.41.1 or newer when supplying its optional CanvasKit peer. Update custom CanvasKit integrations to use `PathBuilder` and immutable `Path` operations.

### Added

- Expose design inspection and undoable layer-property and variable edits to browser agents through experimental WebMCP in supporting browsers, with explicit Off, Inspect, and Edit access controls in Settings.
- Control custom tool exposure independently through `mcp`, `ai`, and `webmcp` exclusions. Tools are included by default, subject to execution support and user permissions.
- Bind Design JSX spacing, sizing, corners, and typography directly to numeric document variables.
- Define component properties and assign instance values in Design JSX using stable property IDs.
- Save AI conversations and attachment previews locally, switch between chats, rename or delete them, and browse saved transcripts across documents. Choose whether reasoning stays collapsed, expands while thinking, or stays expanded, with animated disclosure controls that respect reduced motion.
- Add a searchable command palette for editor and application actions.
- Search current AI provider catalogs from model pickers, with curated recommendations, recent compatible models, and offline fallbacks.
- Render triangle and line arrow stroke caps on lines and open vector paths, and choose them from the stroke cap picker.
- Expose component properties and instance-swap targets through the Figma API and automation.
- Create, select, move, duplicate, transfer, and delete canvas and frame guides directly from rulers, with undoable edits, measurements, context-menu actions, and `.fig` round-trip fidelity.
- Open to a unified home with recent and configured storage documents in grid or list layouts, and open multiple selected design files in separate tabs.
- Snap vector points, moved layers, and resized edges to nearby geometry, guides, frame and canvas bounds, and whole-pixel coordinates, with visible alignment guides and persistent snapping preferences.
- Run Pi through AI SDK HarnessAgent as a configurable desktop provider with saved model profiles, secure credentials, existing MCP design tools, and per-profile thinking and permission settings.
- Combine components into variant sets through Figma API scripts and automation.
- Add local AI usage and technical diagnostics, including token telemetry, provider/model summaries, recent failures, configurable retention, export, and clear controls (#588).
- Import, render, edit, resize, select, and export Figma text-on-path layers while preserving their curved glyph layout.
- Show temporary Figma-style distance measurements between selected and Option/Alt-hovered layers (#491).
- Edit Design JSX and HTML/CSS previews in CodeMirror, with theme-aware highlighting, Tailwind viewing, completion, diagnostics, bounded execution, and session-level undo (#130).
- Set provider-specific reasoning effort on supported AI model profiles (#454).
- Show unavailable or substituted document fonts with affected-layer selection and retry actions, and expose font fidelity through the Figma API, MCP, and `openpencil fonts [file] --json`. Choose `warn`, `strict`, or `allow` font-substitution policies for file-backed CLI raster and PDF exports with `--font-policy` (#503, #625).
- Add reusable remote MCP connections for ACP agents, with Streamable HTTP endpoints and credential-backed bearer tokens.
- Author and manage multidimensional component variants and published component libraries, including revision previews, linked-instance updates, stable library identities, offline catalogs, storage-backed catalogs, and read-only library definitions (#239).
- Recover unsaved and pathless documents locally, including after closing their tabs, with options to disable recovery and restore or discard retained snapshots (#487, #505, #574).
- Inspect selected designs with a configured Vision model and attach images to AI chat with bounded analysis and previews (#232, #471).
- Pin selected layers as explicit AI chat context, show collapsible reasoning, copy individual responses, and grow the composer with multiline prompts (#13).

### Changed

- Explore editable component, typography, and paint comparisons in the demo, with the original examples preserved on a reference page.
- Use compact desktop Home search actions with consistent responsive layout and control sizing.
- Keep pixel-grid rounding invisible while showing alignment guides only for real geometry, objects, and canvas/layout guides.
- Embed images when copying selections into Figma, and preserve geometry, text sizing, component links, variables, modes, and shared styles when pasting within OpenPencil.
- Choose the app theme and whether animations follow the system or stay off under Appearance in General Settings, with live updates and persistent preferences.
- Simplify property panels with fill and stroke style pickers in section headers, concise effect style rows, and collapsed equal corner fields when all four share a variable. Preserve applied and missing styles and remove the redundant Dimensions heading for text layers.
- Open variable pickers below their trigger when space permits, flipping above near the viewport edge.
- Keep AI chat preferences with the model overview and edit models in a fixed-size Settings pane with explicit Save and Cancel actions.
- Match page-list density to the layer tree and add subtle, reduced-motion-aware dialog transitions.
- Fade in streaming Markdown list items and code lines without animating completed responses.
- Vertically center shaped section titles and allow renaming a section by double-clicking its canvas label.
- Load supported online fonts before revealing imported pages, preserve substituted text during editing, and shape canvas labels with Inter typography and shared Arabic/CJK font fallback.
- Complete translated app, accessibility, font, color, file, clipboard, collaboration, chat, vectorization, storage, recovery, component-library, and connection feedback across supported locales, and synchronize document language with the selected locale.
- Separate local MCP server controls, browser WebMCP access, and remote connections in Settings, with inline searchable tool permissions.
- Show translated field errors, hints, and consistent contextual alerts in Settings forms, focus the first invalid field on submission, and explain missing requirements instead of silently disabling Save or Test.
- Pan horizontally with Shift+wheel while preserving native horizontal trackpad movement.

### Fixed

- Preserve circles, ellipses, rectangles, lines, polylines, and polygons supplied as JSX children of inline SVG elements (#452).
- Stop local MCP servers after the app disconnects instead of leaving orphaned background processes (#494).
- Prevent unbounded instance duplication when editing Figma-imported or pasted components with serialized or renamed children, keep extra instance children in their intended order, and avoid pasted instances re-linking pre-existing instances during clipboard import.

### Performance

- Reduce pauses after repeated frame creation without leaving hidden property edits or popups active.
- Reduce repeated text shaping and scene invalidation while moving and resizing objects, and reuse fitting canvas labels during zoom.
- Reduce unnecessary layout work after automation and Figma API edits by updating only affected layers and containers.

### Security

- Protect new real-time collaboration sessions with stronger invitation credentials.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-08-10

### Breaking changes

- **Core SDK:** Import scene graph types, geometry, coordinate, matrix, snapping, undo, and path helpers from `@open-pencil/scene-graph`; import `.pen` parsing from `@open-pencil/pen`; import synchronous Kiwi decompression from `@open-pencil/kiwi` instead of the `@open-pencil/core` compatibility barrel; use uppercase acronym casing in exported identifiers, including `JSONObject`, `JSONArray`, `JSONValue`, `RPCCommand`, and `executeRPCCommand`; and use the renamed tool exports `importSVG`, `exportSVG`, `exportPDF`, `getJSX`, `diffJSX`, and `setPexelsAPIKey`.

## 0.13.2 — 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Update the Homebrew install command to use the published `openpencil` cask.

### Fixed

- Fix the published MCP package so global installs include the `openpencil-mcp` and `openpencil-mcp-http` launchers required by desktop app integrations.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Fix the npm package contents for the CLI so Bun installs include the built `openpencil` binary and runtime bundle.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Fix the published CLI package so Bun global installs run the built `openpencil` binary instead of raw TypeScript sources.

- Greatly improve importing Figma `.fig` files with complex component systems: badges, avatars, icons, links, input fields, lists, date pickers, nested instances, component swaps, and variant properties now open much closer to their original Figma appearance.
- Fix missing or white content in imported `.fig` files caused by unresolved Figma variable bindings, including image/avatar badges, icon colors, text colors, and variable-backed component overrides.
- Preserve more Figma document details when opening and saving `.fig` files, including internal component pages, component ordering, page metadata, canvas backgrounds, text layout, glyph rendering, vector geometry, effects, shadows, and instance overrides.
- Keep user edits after opening an imported `.fig` file: changing size, position, fills, text, or layout now wins over preserved Figma round-trip data when the document is saved again.
- Fix `.fig` exports so files reopened in Figma or OpenPencil keep their pages, components, instances, text wrapping, icons, avatars, and preview thumbnail intact.
- Fix live canvas updates during move/resize/edit previews so visible scene changes repaint immediately.
- Fix accidental duplicate creation when Alt-clicking without dragging.

- Fix CanvasKit loading outside the browser when project paths contain spaces.
- Render imported Figma layer and fill blend modes such as multiply, screen, overlay, difference, hue, saturation, color, and luminosity.
- Render common imported Figma mask stacks so visible layers above alpha, vector, or luminance masks are clipped by the mask shape, including consecutive mask layers.
- Render Figma-style smoothed rectangle corners, including independent corner radii, and effect blend modes from imported Figma files.
- Improve imported tiled image fills by applying Figma image transforms when repeating image patterns.
- Keep imported Figma boolean operations editable as boolean-operation nodes instead of flattening them to vectors.
- Apply imported variable font axes from Figma `fontVariations` when rendering text.
- Render more imported Figma visual metadata, including text decoration styles, leading trim, pattern fills, layout grids, page guides, and deterministic fallbacks for raw noise effects.

### Performance

- Open large `.fig` files faster by deferring work for pages you have not viewed yet while still preparing all needed content before export.
- Improve canvas responsiveness during zooming, panning, dragging, and editing by reusing cached scene backing where safe.
- Speed up `.fig` export for documents with many preserved Figma paint and variable payloads.

## 0.12.2 — 2026-05-19

### Added

- Allow OpenRouter users to enter any model ID from provider settings with cached autocomplete suggestions for tool-capable models, while keeping the curated dropdown as the default when no custom model is set.

### Changed

- Use localized app tooltips instead of native browser titles across editor controls, panels, and menus.
- Update Claude Code MCP setup documentation and the docs landing screenshot.
- Ignore non-source Markdown files in the app dev watcher so documentation edits do not reload the running editor.

### Fixed

- Route Claude Code stdio MCP requests through the live OpenPencil app connection, including immediate disconnected errors when no document is connected.
- Keep MCP disconnected guidance focused on starting OpenPencil and opening a document.
- Improve agent-rendered JSX compatibility with Figma-style text, alignment, and rotation aliases; strip HTML comments; and report unsupported props from render tools.
- Load exact text font styles after MCP and AI tool mutations so newly created bold/weighted text renders immediately.

### Fixed

- Fix `.fig` round-trips for OpenPencil component sets and variable bindings, and recompute imported layouts after opening documents.
- Report desktop/MCP package version mismatches explicitly and include package-manager-aware install guidance from the MCP server.
- Support scoped MCP `save_file({ path })` workflows while keeping file saving in the desktop app.
- Use native Tauri path handling for save parent directories so Unicode and Windows paths are handled correctly.
- Fix the web font picker so Google Fonts remain available in Safari, local font access is requested on first open when supported, font sources are labeled, and Google font previews load lazily for visible rows.
- Fix background blur rendering so it blurs the backdrop behind a layer instead of applying a no-op content filter, and keep effect parameter controls visible in the properties panel.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-05-18

### Added

- Assets panel — browse, search, and insert document components directly from the left sidebar.
- Component variants — switch instance variants from the right inspector; default variant respects property definitions.
- Figma library metadata — component keys, source libraries, version IDs, descriptions, and docs links are preserved on import/export.
- Desktop file associations — double-click `.fig` or `.pen` files in Finder/Explorer to open them in OpenPencil.
- Auto-update — startup update checks and a Check for Updates menu item on desktop.
- Light theme with theme-aware canvas rulers.
- PDF export — available in the export panel, CLI (`--format pdf`), and MCP.
- SVG import tool for automation workflows.
- DeepSeek AI provider.

- Boolean operations panel control and canvas context-menu entries for flattening and outlining supported selections.

### Changed

- Smaller domain modules across core, app, Vue SDK, CLI, MCP, docs, and desktop with enforced package boundaries.
- Separate scene and overlay canvas layers — rulers, labels, and selections no longer cause scene redraws.
- Shared menu schema between browser and native Tauri menus.
- Editor command metadata now drives shortcut display across browser menus, native menus, tooltips, and context menus.
- Text-to-vector conversion now uses shared loaded-font outline geometry across Boolean, flatten, and outline commands.

### Fixed

- Fix `.fig` export of component variant properties and text stretch alignment so designs round-trip correctly through Figma.
- Fix CJK and Arabic text rendering — fallback fonts now load before the first paint instead of showing blank text.
- Fix large `.fig` files freezing on open — parsing runs in a worker, and the viewport fits to content after loading.
- Improve Figma import fidelity — variable aliases, nested instances, avatar swaps, badge internals, and input text alignment are preserved.
- Improve Figma export fidelity — flipped vectors, stroke geometry, visual overflow, and stroked-shape drop shadows are preserved.
- Fix variant switching so instances update their contents, not just the component reference.
- Fix text editing inside components and instances on double-click.
- Fix paste into selected containers and entered frames.
- Fix clipboard parsing to safely ignore invalid data.

- Fix asset insertion coordinates inside entered containers.
- Fix MCP stdio handshake and eval return values.
- Fix `@open-pencil/vue` npm imports referencing an unexported core subpath.
- Fix Figma clipboard text compatibility — pasted OpenPencil text keeps editable fixed bounds, line wrapping, baselines, glyph offsets, and Figma edit-mode layout.
- Fix local font matching so requested upright and weighted faces do not fall back to italic or regular faces.
- Fix CanvasKit paragraph rendering to preserve requested text weights and slants.
- Fix nested text editing interactions — drill double-click enters nested text edit mode, and clicking another text node switches edit targets while editing.
- Fix auto-height text edit commits so text bounds and undo state stay in sync.
- Fix Boolean, flatten, and outline operations to reject unsupported image/complex-script sources safely instead of silently dropping geometry.
- Fix outline stroke enablement for stroked descendants inside groups and containers.

### Performance

- Event-driven canvas rendering — scene and overlay layers only repaint when their inputs change, replacing continuous polling.
- Shared RAF scheduler coalesces scene and overlay frames into a single animation frame per editor.
- Font-family fallback arrays and downloaded remote fonts are cached to avoid repeated work.
- WebGL draw-call instrumentation only runs while the profiler is active.
- Instance override resolution is cached and `.fig` pages load lazily for large files.
- Live drag/resize uses repaint-only previews to skip layout during interaction.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-03-30

### Added

- Lock and visibility toggle buttons in layers panel (hover to reveal, always shown when active).
- Figma-style selection scope — double-click to enter groups/frames/components, Escape to exit.
- Nested container navigation — each double-click goes one level deeper.
- Dashed border around entered container for visual feedback.
- Layer panel click syncs canvas scope automatically.
- Vue SDK internationalization primitives — `useI18n()`, locale detection, persisted locale selection, lazy-loaded locale JSON files, and exported locale metadata for custom editor shells.
- Vue SDK docs and public API audit — documented advanced exports (`useOkHCL()`, variables helpers, viewport and locale APIs), aligned docs with the actual `provideEditor()` injection model, and expanded release-ready SDK guidance.
- npm release pipeline now publishes `@open-pencil/core`, `@open-pencil/cli`, `@open-pencil/mcp`, and `@open-pencil/vue` together on version tags.
- App language picker in the menu bar — switch UI locale without reloading.
- Added a vector curve editor and improved drawing experience with the pen tool.
- Resume pen drawing from existing open path endpoints — click an endpoint to continue the curve.
- Close open paths by dragging one endpoint to the other.
- Align selected anchor points relative to each other in vector edit mode — the standard alignment buttons in the position panel now operate on selected vertices when 2 or more are selected.
- Unified core IO format registry — `.fig` is now modeled as the native document format alongside shared export adapters for PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG, and JSX.
- Export selection or current page as `.fig` from the app export UI and app menu.
- New CLI commands: `open-pencil convert` for document conversion, `open-pencil formats` to inspect readable/writable/exportable formats, and `open-pencil lint` for design consistency, structure, and accessibility checks.
- CLI export now supports `.fig` output and routes PNG/JPG/WEBP/SVG/JSX/`.fig` through the shared IO layer.
- `Open…` now supports `.pen` Pencil documents through the shared document reader pipeline while keeping `.fig` as the native save format.
- Display‑P3 document color space pipeline — documents now default to Display‑P3, `.fig` import/export preserves document color profiles, the live canvas requests P3 surfaces with sRGB fallback, and raster/SVG export paths accept explicit color-space targets.
- Color picker overhaul — unified `RGB` / `HSL` / `HSB` / `OkHCL` field formats, slider-space-aware track/thumb previews, and better neutral-color editing behavior for fills, strokes, gradient stops, and component fills.
- OkHCL metadata now round-trips through `.fig` plugin data and integrates directly into the main fill/stroke color workflow with preview gamut diagnostics.
- Vue SDK now exposes reusable color-picker model helpers and solid fill/stroke commit helpers for custom editor shells.
- Update built-in Z.ai and MiniMax model lists — Z.ai now uses the Anthropic-compatible endpoint for GLM coding models, adds GLM-5.1, and MiniMax adds M2.7 / M2.7-highspeed.
- Arabic and RTL support across text rendering, editing, layout, export, and AI tooling — text nodes support `Auto`/`LTR`/`RTL`, auto-layout frames support `Auto`/`LTR`/`RTL` flow, and JSX/AI prompts/tools can now generate and edit both explicitly.

### Fixed

- Fix shortcuts, now work on non-English keyboard layouts.
- Fix imported `.fig` file open and page-switch regressions — loaded documents now keep graph/store state in sync, remap imported canvas/page children correctly, and recompute imported auto-layout descendants when switching pages.
- Fix first canvas render happening before fonts load — wait for fonts before the initial draw to avoid Safari and text measurement glitches.
- Preserve `fig-kiwi` version on `.fig` roundtrip — imports keep the original header version instead of rewriting everything to a hardcoded value; new files default to version 101.
- Normalize auto-layout text export for Figma — text children inside auto-layout frames now serialize with `NONE` auto-resize to match Figma behavior and avoid overflow on reimport.
- Fix keyboard editing regressions after the refactor — canvas shortcuts no longer fire while editing text, and Delete/Backspace no longer delete nodes during text entry.
- Fix MCP page switching persistence — `switch_page` now survives across tool calls in the same session.
- Improve CJK font fallback coverage — load multiple Google Fonts for broader Han/Japanese/Korean text support.
- Normalize more visible UI strings for localized app chrome — menus, panels, variables dialog, code panel, chat setup, and editor controls now respect the selected locale instead of falling back to English in common flows.
- Fix imported text rendering in browser and headless export — preserve stored bounds until fonts are ready, restore missing font-loaded guards, use natural width for `WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT` text, and clip text to node bounds.
- Fix browser/headless rendering mismatch for imported toolbar/instance content by correcting runtime imported layout recomputation instead of diverging browser rendering behavior.
- Fix `set_layout` tool not defaulting to HUG sizing when enabling auto-layout — frames now shrink/grow to fit children instead of keeping fixed dimensions.
- Normalize font family names on `.fig` export — strip optical size suffixes (e.g. "DM Sans 9pt" → "DM Sans") so Figma recognizes the font.
- TEXT nodes now default to a solid black fill — previously exported with no fill, making text invisible when opened in Figma.
- Fix save crash when COLOR variable is missing alpha channel.
- Fix console error spam on deployed web app from automation WebSocket reconnect loop.
- Fix headless CLI font fallback — bundled Inter font now ships with `@open-pencil/core` and loads without a web server.
- Locked nodes now block move, resize, rotate, and delete on canvas.
- Locked containers block double-click enter.
- Marquee selection skips locked and hidden nodes.
- COMPONENT/INSTANCE containers are now enterable via double-click.

- Skeleton-first AI workflow — 4-phase design process (plan → skeleton → content fill via `replace_id` → polish) for more reliable AI-generated layouts.
- Batched AI tools — `calc` accepts arrays of expressions, `stock_photo` fetches all images in parallel, `batch_update` applies multiple property changes in one call, `describe` accepts `ids` array for multi-node inspection.
- AI visual feedback — blue pulsing border on nodes being modified, green flash on completion.
- Auto-depth `describe` — adapts inspection depth to subtree size (small block → deeper, large page → shallower).
- `set_fill` gradient support — linear gradients with `color_end` and `gradient` direction params.
- `render` tool `replace_id` — atomically swap skeleton placeholders with real content.
- MCP `export_image_file` tool for headless PNG rendering.
- Grid layout in AI chat — JSX renderer supports `grid`, `columns`, `rows`, `gap` props.
- Configurable max output tokens in AI provider settings (default 16384).
- Z.ai AI provider with GLM-5, GLM-4.7, GLM-4.6, GLM-4.5 model families.
- MiniMax AI provider with M2.5, M2.1, M2 models.

- Fix detached ArrayBuffer crash when switching pages after saving — export worker now copies image buffers before transferring.
- Show warning toast when fonts fail to load, error toast when file open fails.
- Fix FillPicker crash when selecting image fills (missing `ref` import from #92).
- Fix Google Fonts TLS/network errors not cached — failed families no longer retry on every render.
- Fix CJK text garbled when font is unavailable — fallback now renders through paragraph shaper instead of raw `drawText`, preserving CJK characters via the fallback font chain.
- Fix auto-layout overflow in AI-generated designs — text wrapping, min/max constraints, absolute positioning, and FILL sizing now work correctly.
- Fix `layoutAlignSelf` limited to STRETCH — full range supported (CENTER, MAX, MIN, BASELINE).
- Fix hidden auto-layout children losing their dimensions on layout recompute.
- Fix ProviderSettings popover not visible in AI chat.
- Fix paste/copy/cut intercepted by canvas in AI chat input.
- Strip TypeScript casts from AI-generated JSX (`as any`, `as const`).
- Fix parsing complex .fig files crashing on missing GUIDs in component overrides.
- Fix headless text layout using 100×100 default size instead of estimated dimensions — multi-line wrapping now estimated correctly.
- Fix clipboard roundtrip losing properties — clipsContent, constraints, arcData, strokeCap/Join, layoutAlignSelf, textAutoResize, autoRename now preserved in Figma Kiwi serialization.
- Fix MCP headless export crashing on `window.queryLocalFonts` in non-browser runtimes (Bun/Node).

- Disable autosave by default.

### Performance

- Offload .fig parsing (unzip + Kiwi decode) to a Web Worker — main thread stays responsive during file open.
- Offload .fig compression to a Web Worker during save (was blocking 450ms+).
- Add instance index (`componentId → Set<nodeId>`) — `getInstances()` is O(1) instead of scanning all nodes.
- Defer graph event subscription until after layout computation during file open — eliminates redundant `syncInstances` calls.
- Cache label collection (sections/components) per scene mutation instead of walking the full tree every frame.
- Blocking font loading — fonts load before first render to ensure correct glyphs.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- XPath query command — `open-pencil query design.fig "//FRAME[@width < 300]"` to find nodes by type, attributes, and tree structure using XPath selectors.
- CSS Grid layout mode — select a frame, click the grid icon in the auto layout toolbar to switch from flex to grid. Configure column/row tracks (fr, fixed px, auto), column and row gaps, and per-side padding. Powered by a [Yoga fork](https://github.com/open-pencil/yoga/tree/grid) with cherry-picked CSS Grid PRs from upstream.
- JSX and Tailwind CSS export for grid layouts — `grid grid-cols-N`, `gap-x-*`/`gap-y-*`, child `col-start-*`/`row-start-*`/`col-span-*`/`row-span-*`.
- Multi-provider AI support — connect to Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint directly, in addition to OpenRouter. Per-provider API key storage, provider settings popover, automatic migration from single OpenRouter key.
- Anthropic-compatible provider for custom API endpoints.
- New AI tools: `get_jsx` (JSX roundtrip view), `diff_jsx` (structural diff), `describe` (semantic role, visual style, layout, design issues).
- AI visual verification — `export_image` returns image content to the model for vision-based review.
- API type toggle (Completions/Responses) for OpenAI-compatible providers.
- Figma zoom shortcuts — ⌘0 (100%), ⌘1 (zoom to fit), ⌘2 (zoom to selection), ⇧1/⇧2 alternatives.

- AI tools run `computeAllLayouts` after execution — layout updates immediately.
- Enhanced AI system prompt with full JSX prop reference and verification workflow.
- Chat panel preserves messages when toggling UI visibility.
- SceneGraph event bus (nanoevents) — `node:created`, `node:updated`, `node:deleted`, `node:reparented`, `node:reordered` events replace monkey-patching in collab sync and manual render invalidation.
- Replace esbuild-wasm (14 MB) with sucrase (201 KB) for JSX transform — `buildComponent()` and `renderJSX()` now synchronous and browser-compatible.
- `useMagicKeys` keyboard shortcut system — replaces tinykeys with VueUse built-in, cross-platform Meta/Control handling, modifier exclusion for combo conflicts.
- Dev-only debug toolbar for copying chat logs.
- Auto-layout icons in layer tree — vertical (rows), horizontal (columns), and grid icons for auto-layout frames; components keep their purple diamond.
- Frame titles on canvas are now draggable — clicking a selected top-level frame's name label starts a drag.
- Compact layout controls — icon-based gap (↔/↕) and padding (T/R/B/L) inputs instead of text labels.
- Auto-detect horizontal vs vertical direction when wrapping in auto layout (Shift+A).
- Fix alignment grid for vertical layouts — visual positions now match spatial axes.

- Remove unwanted white fill when wrapping in auto layout.

### Fixed

- Serialize variables, collections, and bindings to `.fig` files — previously lost on save (#65).
- Text nodes created via MCP now render in Figma — emit `derivedTextData` with font metadata and layout size (#64).
- Double-click on layer tree no longer toggles expand/collapse — use the chevron instead.
- Page rename input matches layer rename styling.
- Fix `w="fill"`/`h="fill"` in JSX renderer — now direction-aware based on parent flex axis.

- Fix text typography lost on Figma clipboard import — preserve fontFamily, fontWeight, fontSize, lineHeight.
- Fix `copyFill` missing `gradientTransform` and `imageTransform` — gradient fills now round-trip correctly.

### Performance

- Event-driven rendering and component sync — `SceneGraph` emits typed events on mutations; `requestRender()` calls reduced from 94 to 22, component instance sync uses microtask batching with deduplication.
- Replace `structuredClone` with typed copy helpers for fills, strokes, effects, and style runs (~24× faster in hot paths).
- Filter .fig unzip to only decompress canvas and image entries, skipping metadata cruft.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-03-07

### Added

- Mobile layout & PWA — responsive editor with touch-optimized toolbar, swipeable bottom drawer (layers/properties/design/code), HUD overlay, and installable PWA with icons and service worker.
- Tailwind CSS v4 JSX export — export selections as HTML with Tailwind utility classes (`<div className="flex gap-4 p-3">`) from the Code panel, CLI (`bun open-pencil export --format jsx --style tailwind`), or programmatically via `sceneNodeToJSX(id, graph, 'tailwind')`. Supports layout, sizing, colors, border radius, opacity, rotation, overflow, shadows, blur, and typography. Uses v4 spacing semantics (px/4 multiplier) with automatic fallback to arbitrary values.
- Code panel format toggle — switch between OpenPencil (custom components) and Tailwind (HTML + utility classes) output.
- Homebrew tap — `brew install open-pencil/tap/open-pencil` for macOS (arm64 + x64), auto-updated on each release.
- Double-click to rename layers — inline rename in layer panel, shared `useInlineRename` composable.
- New AI/MCP tools: `analyze_colors`, `analyze_typography`, `analyze_spacing`, `analyze_clusters`, `diff_create`, `diff_show`, `get_components`, `get_current_page`, `arrange`, `node_to_component`.
- CLI-to-app RPC bridge — all CLI commands work against the running app when no file is specified. Start the app, then run `bun open-pencil tree` to inspect the live document.
- VitePress docs site — user guide, reference, architecture, and development docs at openpencil.dev with 6 locales (en, de, fr, es, it, pl), SEO (OG tags, hreflang, JSON-LD, sitemap), and dark theme.

### Changed

- Refactor mobile drawer tabs, layout sizing dropdowns, and inline rename to use Reka UI primitives.
- Add shared UI style helpers with tailwind-variants for menus, selects, buttons, and surfaces.
- Unified tool definitions — define once in `packages/core/src/tools/`, automatically available in AI chat, CLI, and MCP.
- Harden FigmaAPI — hide internals via Symbols, freeze arrays, fix `layoutSizing`, 30+ new properties and methods.

- Replace inline type definitions with named types (`Color`, `Vector`, `SceneNode`) across the codebase.
- Split 3200-line `renderer.ts` into `packages/core/src/renderer/` with 10 focused files (scene, overlays, fills, strokes, shapes, effects, rulers, labels).
- Centralize all color utilities in `packages/core/src/color.ts` — `colorToHex8`, `colorToCSSCompact`, `normalizeColor`, `colorDistance`; remove 5 duplicate implementations across the codebase.
- Add `geometry.ts` with shared rotation math (`degToRad`, `radToDeg`, `rotatePoint`, `rotatedCorners`, `rotatedBBox`).
- Extract `isArrayMixed()` helper for multi-selection property panels.


- Add `motion-v` for declarative animations — used in mobile drawer (spring-animated height with pan gestures) and toolbar (layout-animated category switching with directional slide transitions).
- Mobile drawer: replace `useSwipe` + manual rAF animation with `motion.div` `:animate` + `@pan`/`@panEnd`; always-on tab state (no more null `activeRibbonTab`); content stays rendered when closed.
- Mobile toolbar: replace manual `scrollWidth` measuring + inline CSS transitions with `motion.div layout` + `AnimatePresence` directional slide variants.
- Mobile UI cleanup: extract shared `colorToCSS` util to core, `initials` to `src/utils/text`, `toolIcons` to `src/utils/tools`; replace hand-rolled dropdowns with reka-ui Popover/DropdownMenu; narrow `mobileDrawerSnap` type to string union; move magic numbers to constants; disable PWA service worker in dev mode.
- 83 new E2E tests (57 → 140): design panel, code panel, components, copy/paste, multi-page, text editing, keyboard shortcuts, context menu.
- 150 new unit tests (588 → 738): color, undo, snap, vector, style-runs, text-editor.
- 48 new E2E tests (9 spec files) + 26 mutation unit tests + store/canvas test helpers.
- Add `data-test-id` attributes to AppearanceSection, LayoutSection, TypographySection, VariablesDialog, EditorView.

### Fixed

- Fix `ALL_TOOLS` registry missing newer tools (`analyzeColors`, `diffCreate`, `exportImage`, `arrangeNodes`).
- Fix `renderJSX` typo in tool definitions (`renderJsx` → `renderJSX`).
- Fix all oxlint warnings and tsgo errors — replace `!` non-null assertions in `use-collab.ts` with local const captures.
- Fix broken test imports — stale `../../src/engine/` paths updated to `@open-pencil/core`.
- Fix flaky E2E tests: layers panel navigates to `/demo`, zoom-to-fit test zooms in first, snapshot rendering stabilized with `workers: 1` and `colorScheme: dark`.
- Fix bogus .fig import mappings for `expanded` and `strokeMiterLimit` fields.
- Fix PWA manifest error in dev mode, handle invalid font data gracefully.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- SVG export — export selections as SVG from the export panel, context menu, CLI (`bun open-pencil export --format svg`), or MCP/AI tools (`export_svg`). Supports rectangles, ellipses, lines, stars, polygons, vectors, text with style runs, gradients, image fills, effects, blend modes, clip paths, and nested groups (#46).
- Copy/Paste as submenu in context menu — Copy as text, Copy as SVG, Copy as PNG (⇧⌘C), Copy as JSX.
- Stroke align (Inside/Center/Outside) with clip-based rendering matching Figma behavior.
- Individual stroke weights per side (Top/Right/Bottom/Left) with side selector dropdown.
- Google Fonts fallback — automatically loads fonts from Google Fonts API when not available locally.
- Auto-save toggle in File menu — disable to prevent automatic writes to the opened .fig file.
- Renderer profiler with in-canvas HUD overlay, GPU timing, and phase instrumentation.

### Changed

- Replace custom color picker with Reka UI Color components (ColorArea, ColorSlider, ColorField) — adds keyboard navigation and accessibility to the color area, hue, and alpha controls.

### Fixed

- CJK text rendering — load a system CJK font (PingFang SC, Microsoft YaHei, Noto Sans CJK) as fallback; falls back to Noto Sans SC from Google Fonts when no system font is available (#48).
- Font registration errors no longer cache invalid font data — `loadFont` only caches after successful CanvasKit registration.
- Fix `render` tool failing on Windows + Bun with "Cannot find module" error (#43).
- Fix hover highlighting nodes from internal component pages — scope hit-test to current page.
- Fix hit-testing on transparent frames and groups — empty containers without fills or strokes are now click-through, clipping parents reject hits outside their bounds, matching Figma behavior.
- Fix instance overrides on .fig import and clipboard paste — resolve guidPaths by overrideKey, handle component swaps (`overriddenSymbolID`), propagate through nested clone chains. Import and paste now share a single override engine.
- Apply Figma component property assignments on import — boolean visibility toggles and instance swaps via `componentPropRefs`/`componentPropAssignments`.
- Apply `derivedSymbolData` sizes on import — containers now shrink correctly when component properties hide children.
- Fix override resolution for nested instance targets — check the current node before searching descendants.
- Fix component property assignments for nested instances — resolve scoped `componentPropAssignments` inside `symbolOverrides` via guidPath, handle `guidValue` for instance swaps, reorder phases so transitive sync doesn't clobber visibility.
- Pixel-perfect vector rendering using pre-computed `fillGeometry`/`strokeGeometry` blobs from .fig files — eliminates white gaps between adjacent stroked shapes.
- Stroke outlines on clipboard paste — convert vectorNetwork paths to filled outlines via CanvasKit when geometry blobs are unavailable.
- Apply `derivedSymbolData` transforms and geometry during import — instance children render at correct scale and position.
- Fix internal pages becoming visible after .fig round-trip — preserve `internalOnly` flag on export.
- Scope layout recomputation to current page for paste/undo/font-load (major speedup on large multi-page files).
- Show loading overlay until all document fonts are loaded (no more partially rendered text).
- Load fonts when switching pages (previously only loaded for the first page).
- Always show visibility toggle on fill, stroke, and effect rows (matches Figma).
- Fix renderer crash on double destroy when closing files quickly.
- Fix .fig page ordering — use deterministic byte comparison for fractional index positions.
- Fix text truncation using `textTruncation` field instead of `textAutoResize`.
- Fix horizontal scrollbar on design and pages panels.
- Style scrollbars for Tauri (thin dark overlay instead of default OS chrome).
- Enable file watcher in Tauri — `watch` feature was missing from `tauri-plugin-fs`.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-03-04

### Added

- Multi-selection properties panel — edit position, size, appearance, fill, stroke, and effects across multiple selected nodes.
- Shared values display normally, differing values show "Mixed".
- W/H inputs in multi-selection mode.
- Flip horizontal/vertical using scale transform instead of rotation.
- Single-node alignment aligns to parent frame bounds.

### Changed

- Apple code signing and notarization for macOS builds.
- Git LFS storage moved from GitHub to Cloudflare R2.

### Fixed

- Fix Figma clipboard paste: extract shared kiwi→SceneNode conversion, fixing broken auto-layout, missing gradient/image fills, effects, style runs, and text properties.
- Fix vector rendering on paste — scale path coordinates from Figma's normalizedSize to actual node bounds.
- Fix pasted instances having no children — populate from component via symbolData when both are in clipboard.
- Detect component sets on import — promote FRAME nodes with VARIANT componentPropDefs to COMPONENT_SET.
- Skip internal canvas on paste — components on Figma's hidden internal page populate instances but are not pasted as visible nodes.
- Apply instance overrides on paste — text content, fills, visibility, layoutGrow, and textAutoResize from symbolOverrides.
- Fix auto-layout child ordering — sort by geometric position instead of z-order position strings.
- Load fonts on paste and .fig import — collect font families from text nodes and load into CanvasKit.
- Text measurement in auto-layout — use CanvasKit paragraph metrics for WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT text nodes.
- Recompute layouts after font loading completes.
- Fix PERCENT line height conversion — was stored as raw value instead of pixels.
- Fix InvalidCharacterError when copying nodes with non-ASCII text.
- Load all font weight/style variants needed by pasted text nodes.
- Fix font loading not registering in core cache.
- Fix halfLeading applied to text measurement — enable only for rendering.
- Clear hover on zoom/pinch to keep scene picture cache valid.
- Fix flip buttons using rotation math instead of actual mirroring.
- Fix flip transform encoding — scale first matrix column only (was incorrectly producing 180° rotation).
- Decode flip state from .fig transform matrix on import.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Render text from SkPicture cache when fonts are missing — pixel-perfect display without the font installed.
- Missing font indicator (⚠) next to font picker in the sidebar.
- Right-click context menu on layers panel — same actions as the canvas context menu.
- 40+ new AI/MCP tools ported from figma-use:
  - Granular set tools: `set_rotation`, `set_opacity`, `set_radius`, `set_minmax`, `set_text`, `set_font`, `set_font_range`, `set_text_resize`, `set_visible`, `set_blend`, `set_locked`, `set_stroke_align`
  - Node operations: `node_bounds`, `node_move`, `node_resize`, `node_ancestors`, `node_children`, `node_tree`, `node_bindings`, `node_replace_with`

  - Misc: `flatten_nodes`, `list_fonts`
- `set_text_properties` tool: alignment, auto-resize, decoration.
- `set_layout_child` tool: sizing, grow, align_self, positioning.
- 13 MCP server integration tests via `InMemoryTransport`.

### Changed

- Layers tree auto-expands and scrolls to reveal selected node.
- Loading overlay on canvas while opening .fig files.
- Hide internal-only pages (e.g. "Internal Only Canvas" in design systems).
- Render page dividers — pages named with only dashes/asterisks/spaces show as horizontal lines.
- Only show component labels for COMPONENT and COMPONENT_SET, not instances.
- Replace all native `<select>` dropdowns with reka-ui `AppSelect` component.
- Smoother trackpad pinch-to-zoom with `Math.exp` curve and deltaMode normalization.
- Fix font picker dropdown truncating long font names.
- Show explanation in font picker when Local Font Access API unavailable (Safari/Firefox).


- Auto-populate GitHub Release notes from CHANGELOG.md via `ffurrer2/extract-release-notes@v2`.
- Skip already-published npm versions on CI re-runs instead of failing.
- Exclude non-app directories from Vite file watcher.


- Extract shared color constants (`BLACK`, `TRANSPARENT`, `DEFAULT_SHADOW_COLOR`) — replaces 8 inline literals across core.
- Extract shared `NodeContextMenuContent` component to avoid menu duplication.
- Fix `@open-pencil/core` dep in MCP package: `workspace:*` for local dev (pnpm resolves at publish time).
- Replace store thunks with a late-binding proxy.


- Clipboard roundtrip tests: encode to Figma Kiwi binary → decode → verify.
- 9 visual regression snapshot tests for effects rendering.
- Zoom/pan E2E tests and pipeline benchmark.
- MCP server edge-case tests for `find_nodes` and Zod validation.
- 6 unit tests for absolute position cache.

### Fixed

- Fix drop shadow rendering on top of fills — shadow now draws behind opaque content.
- Fix effect property changes not recorded in undo/redo history.
- Fix active tab text invisible against same-color background.
- Fix clipboard "Outside int range" error — `pasteID` used unsigned int exceeding Kiwi's signed 32-bit field.
- Error toasts are now sticky (don't auto-dismiss), with selectable text, copy button, and close button.
- Truncate long node names in export button.

### Performance

- Per-node SkPicture cache for effect rendering — unchanged shadow/blur nodes replay from cache on scene redraws.
- Drop shadows use `MaskFilter` direct draw instead of `saveLayer` offscreen buffers.
- Cached `ImageFilter`, `MaskFilter`, reusable effect paint — zero per-frame WASM allocations for effects.
- Reuse GL context on panel resize — swap surface without recreating renderer, preserving all caches.
- Per-frame absolute position cache — avoids repeated parent-chain walks during rendering.
- Optimize zoom/pan smoothness with `shallowReactive`, `useRafFn`, and input coalescing.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-03-02

- Import additional properties from Figma clipboard: `layoutAlignSelf`, `clipsContent`, `fontWeight`, `italic`, `letterSpacing`, `lineHeight`.
- Convert `letterSpacing` PERCENT units to pixels based on font size.


- 7 new clipboard import unit tests (14 total).

### Fixed

- Fix Figma clipboard paste: skip non-visual node types (variables, widgets, stickies, connectors).
- Fix text not rendering after paste — `letterSpacing` from Figma is a `{value, units}` object, was passed as-is → `NaN` broke CanvasKit paragraph layout.
- Fix undo/redo for Figma paste — no undo entry was recorded; redo duplicated `childIds`.
- Center pasted Figma content in viewport instead of using original coordinates.
- Compute auto-layouts after clipboard paste (same as .fig import and demo creation).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-03-02

### Changed

- Highlight copy & paste with Figma in README and feature docs.
- Replace "fig-kiwi" format name with "Kiwi binary" — the format is shared between .fig files and clipboard.

### Fixed

- `openpencil-mcp` and `openpencil-mcp-http` binaries — install globally via `bun add -g @open-pencil/mcp`.

### Changed

- All packages emit JS via tsgo + fix-esm-import-path — `@open-pencil/core` and `@open-pencil/mcp` work on Node.js without Bun.
- Core package exports: `bun` condition → src (dev), `import` condition → dist (npm consumers).
- `@open-pencil/mcp` added to CI publish workflow.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-03-02

### Changed

- Visual regression tests for SkPicture cache: hover on/off cycle, multiple cycles, mouse hover, scene change + hover.
- Type `window.__OPEN_PENCIL_STORE__` globally, remove ad-hoc casts from tests.

### Performance

- Re-apply SkPicture scene caching for ~7x faster pan/zoom (0.98ms vs 6.8ms per frame at 500 nodes).

## 0.3.1 — 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- Fix macOS startup hang: async font loading, show window on reopen.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
